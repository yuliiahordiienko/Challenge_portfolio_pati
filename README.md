# Task 1: software configuration.

## “Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?”

###### Being a QA specialist has been my dream for a long time.  I already have experience in IT, before my maternity leave I worked as a Project Manager.  But I am not backing down from my dream, and I want to be a QA specialist.  I chose Dare IT because it is the largest women's community in Poland. And I believe, that Dare IT is an ideal company that helps in acquiring the necessary skills in QA (and in others specialties as well), especially for beginners.  Dare IT makes it possible to get advice from a real specialist, and by holding meetings in Zoom, motivate us for a good result 🤝.
###### I am very happy to take part in this challenge and will do my best to become a part of the Dare IT team.  Dare IT is my path to my dream 💪.
